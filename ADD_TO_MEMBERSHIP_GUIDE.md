};

await addOnServicesService.create(newService);
```

3. **Booking submission fails**: Check Firebase connection and auth
4. **Styling issues**: Verify Tailwind classes and CSS imports

### Debug Commands (Browser Console):
```javascript
// Check available services
console.log(await addOnServicesService.getAll());

// Check bookings
console.log(await serviceBookingsService.getAll());

// Test service creation
await addAddOnServices();
```
